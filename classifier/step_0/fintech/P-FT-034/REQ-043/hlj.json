  "text": "Subject: Update on CAD Round-Up Feature and Beta Opt-In Opportunity\n\nHi Karen,\n\nThanks so much for your patience regarding the rollout of our CAD round-up feature—I apologize for the unexpected delay. Your feedback has been invaluable, and we sincerely appreciate your understanding as we work diligently to get everything right.\n\nI'm happy to share that we’re firmly committed to enabling CAD round-up accounts by 1 July 2025. To ensure a smooth transition, we’ll be offering early beta access starting next week, and we’d love to have you participate. You’ll receive a follow-up email with detailed instructions on how to opt in. Migrating your existing funds will be straightforward—simply confirm the transfer within your account dashboard when prompted, and your current savings will automatically carry over to the new CAD account. If you have any further questions or need assistance during this process, feel free to reach out.\n\nWarm regards,  \nThe SaveRound Team  \nsupport@saveround.io",
