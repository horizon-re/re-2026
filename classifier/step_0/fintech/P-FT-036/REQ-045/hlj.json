  "text": "Investor interest ahead of our Series B close on August 30, 2025, has zeroed in on one standout feature: AI-powered allowance insights for teen debit users. This demand reflects a broader market appetite for value-added financial literacy tools embedded in youth banking products. Several VCs have flagged actionable, personalized insights as a must-have differentiator, especially as we position ourselves against larger fintech incumbents. To meet this expectation and demonstrate traction, we propose a key performance indicator: 90% of parents actively view their teen’s spending insights at least once per month.\n\nTo deliver on this, we’ll first ingest categorized spend data and apply clustering algorithms to identify behavioral patterns. From there, we can generate three concise, parent-facing tips each week within the app interface—focusing on saving habits, budgeting signals, and unusual spend patterns. A/B testing against a control group will help validate engagement lift and message effectiveness. All data handling and delivery will remain COPPA-compliant to ensure safe and responsible usage for our under-13 segment.",
