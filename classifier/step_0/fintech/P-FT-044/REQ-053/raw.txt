User Personas

1. Olivia Chen — Operations Manager
	•	Background: 8+ years managing supply chain operations in a mid-sized manufacturing company.
	•	Goals: Wants accurate forecasts to optimize inventory levels, minimize waste, and avoid stockouts.
	•	Frustrations: Past tools were too rigid — she needs customization based on seasonal changes and anomalies.

2. Daniel Ruiz — Financial Analyst
	•	Background: Junior financial analyst in a fast-scaling SaaS company.
	•	Goals: Forecast subscription revenue churn and upsells to report realistic financial plans.
	•	Frustrations: Overly volatile forecasts from AI tools that “overreact” to minor fluctuations.

3. Priya Patel — Product Manager
	•	Background: PM for an AI-first logistics platform.
	•	Goals: Integrate forecasting into her product to enable customers to predict delivery times and demand surges.
	•	Frustrations: API-based tools without clean documentation or rate limits that throttle at peak times.

Functional Requirements

Core Forecasting
	•	Provide time-series forecasting for numeric KPIs (inventory, revenue, usage metrics).
	•	Allow users to input historical data manually or via integrations.
	•	Forecast horizon customizable: 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, 1 year.
	•	Model selection: AutoML (default), with manual override options for ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM models for advanced users.

Alerting
	•	Threshold-based alerts for forecasted metrics (e.g., stock expected to run out within 10 days).
	•	Smart anomaly alerts: Detect deviations from forecasted trends automatically.
	•	Alert delivery options: Email, SMS, Webhook.

Reporting
	•	Daily, weekly, monthly forecast summary reports.
	•	Comparison reports: Forecast vs. Actual with deviation analysis.
	•	Export formats: CSV, PDF, JSON.

Non‑Functional Requirements

Scalability
	•	Support 10,000+ simultaneous forecasts across multiple organizations.
	•	Horizontal auto-scaling enabled via Kubernetes and container orchestration.

Availability
	•	99.9% uptime target (measured monthly).
	•	Graceful degradation: read-only mode if backend services are down.

Performance
	•	Forecast generation time must not exceed 5 seconds for <100,000 data points.
	•	Alert processing latency under 1 second after data ingestion.

⸻

AI Sensitivity Slider

Description:
	•	Users adjust the “sensitivity” of forecasts using a simple slider:
	•	Conservative Mode (left side): Favors stability. Less responsive to minor data fluctuations.
	•	Volatile Mode (right side): Hyper-reactive to recent changes, suitable for dynamic environments.
	•	Intermediate states provide a weighted blend based on exponential smoothing factors.
	•	Default setting is Balanced at 50%.

Example:
Olivia managing seasonal inventory sets the slider toward Conservative during stable months, then shifts it toward Volatile during unpredictable seasons (e.g., Black Friday).
