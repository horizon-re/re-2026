  "text": "## Interview Meta\nDate: 2025-04-18  \nParticipants: Julia (CSM), Dylan (COO)  \nPlan Tier: Enterprise-Annual\n\n## Raw Notes\n- So, um, the main thing we're seeing, uh, {pain-point} is that upgrading, you know, it's just too complicated right now. I mean, users, they gotta jump through, like, hoops to even find where to do it.\n- Like, [OPEN QUESTION] How are users supposed to know where to go when they want to upgrade their plan? There's gotta be a simpler way.\n- And cancellations? Yeah, {pain-point}, they shouldn't have to call support just to cancel. It's like we're making them jump through hoops again, you know?\n- Sometimes users actually get stuck between plans, and, um, they end up paying for both. {delight} Fixing that could really make their day.\n- We've been thinking, for upgrades, maybe we could just put a big button right on the dashboard. Like, \"Upgrade Now\" or something. Keep it simple, you know?\n- And for cancellations, maybe a self-serve option right there, no need to hunt for it. Just straightforward, click, and done.\n- The AI stuff? Yeah, we're exploring ML for predicting when someone might churn. It's like, preemptively giving them reasons to stay, you know? {pain-point}\n- Oh, and this LLM FAQ thing, yeah, it could be huge. Imagine the time saved if customers could just get answers right away, without calling in.\n\n## Emerging Themes\n1. Upgrades\n   - Users struggle to find upgrade options easily.\n   - Simplify with a prominent \"Upgrade Now\" button.\n   \n2. Cancellations\n   - Current process requires unnecessary steps.\n   - Implement straightforward self-serve cancellation.\n   \n3. AI Opportunities\n   - ML \"Churn Predictor\" to anticipate customer departures.\n   - LLM FAQ Generator for instant customer support.\n\n## Action Items\n- [ ] Draft journey map (Owner: UX)\n- [ ] Validate churn model inputs (Owner: Data)\n- [ ] ... leave one checkbox blank",
