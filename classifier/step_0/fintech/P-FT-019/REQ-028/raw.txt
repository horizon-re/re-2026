## Interview Meta
Date: 2025-04-18  
Participants: Julia (CSM), Dylan (COO)  
Plan Tier: Enterprise-Annual

## Raw Notes
- So, um, the main thing we're seeing, uh, {pain-point} is that upgrading, you know, it's just too complicated right now. I mean, users, they gotta jump through, like, hoops to even find where to do it.
- Like, [OPEN QUESTION] How are users supposed to know where to go when they want to upgrade their plan? There's gotta be a simpler way.
- And cancellations? Yeah, {pain-point}, they shouldn't have to call support just to cancel. It's like we're making them jump through hoops again, you know?
- Sometimes users actually get stuck between plans, and, um, they end up paying for both. {delight} Fixing that could really make their day.
- We've been thinking, for upgrades, maybe we could just put a big button right on the dashboard. Like, "Upgrade Now" or something. Keep it simple, you know?
- And for cancellations, maybe a self-serve option right there, no need to hunt for it. Just straightforward, click, and done.
- The AI stuff? Yeah, we're exploring ML for predicting when someone might churn. It's like, preemptively giving them reasons to stay, you know? {pain-point}
- Oh, and this LLM FAQ thing, yeah, it could be huge. Imagine the time saved if customers could just get answers right away, without calling in.

## Emerging Themes
1. Upgrades

   - Implement straightforward self-serve cancellation.
   
3. AI Opportunities
   - ML "Churn Predictor" to anticipate customer departures.
   - LLM FAQ Generator for instant customer support.
