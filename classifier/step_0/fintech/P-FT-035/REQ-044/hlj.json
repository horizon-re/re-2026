  "text": "The ACH retry engine must implement a structured retry mechanism for failed debit transactions, adhering to a maximum of three retry attempts per failure, utilizing exponential backoff beginning with a 4-hour delay. Retries must be disabled for any account marked with the risk_tier field set to \"high\". A dedicated retry window is enforced over weekends, specifically from Saturday 06:00 UTC to Sunday 22:00 UTC, during which retries may be scheduled and executed. For each failed retry attempt, the engine must POST a failure notification within two minutes to https://ops.webhook.company/retry_failed, ensuring the JSON payload includes the keys txnId, attempt, and reason. The ach_retry_weekend feature must be controlled via a feature flag, defaulting to OFF in production environments, and may only be enabled upon formal QA approval and sign-off to ensure stability and compliance with operational policies.",
