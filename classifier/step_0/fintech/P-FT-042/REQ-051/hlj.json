  "text": "Scope Document – DeFi Yield Aggregation Platform\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe DeFi yield aggregation platform is built to empower decentralized finance users seeking maximized returns with minimized complexity. Our mission is to abstract away the difficulty of manually navigating multiple yield farms, liquidity pools, and staking opportunities across chains. By leveraging smart strategies, automated optimizations, and risk-managed exposure, the platform targets crypto-savvy individuals, DAOs, and asset managers who prioritize capital efficiency without sacrificing transparency. Initially launching on Ethereum, with a vision to rapidly expand to BSC and Polygon, the platform aims to serve yield farmers frustrated with fragmented ecosystems and inefficient capital allocation tools.\n\nArchitecture Modules\n\nThe platform architecture is composed of three primary modules: the Vault Aggregator, the Yield Optimizer, and the Risk Oracle.\n\nThe Vault Aggregator is responsible for pooling user deposits and allocating them across selected yield-generating strategies. Inputs include user deposits, target allocation percentages, and strategy metadata. Outputs are tokenized vault shares representing user ownership stakes. This module integrates with major lending and farming protocols such as Aave, Compound, and Curve, using external smart contracts to deploy and reallocate assets dynamically.\n\nThe Yield Optimizer continuously monitors available strategies to maximize returns. Inputs are live yield rates, gas fee estimates, and vault allocation states. Outputs are rebalancing instructions sent to the Vault Aggregator. It integrates with price feeds from Chainlink and custom-built gas oracles to optimize for net gains after transaction costs. Additionally, it interfaces with external strategy repositories to dynamically discover new yield opportunities as they emerge.\n\nThe Risk Oracle module serves as the platform’s internal risk assessor. Inputs include real-time protocol risk scores, TVL metrics, smart contract audit histories, and oracle reliability data. Outputs are risk-adjusted APYs and risk flags associated with each strategy. The module integrates with third-party risk monitoring tools and DeFi insurance providers to dynamically adjust vault composition based on systemic risk levels.\n\nRisk Considerations\n\nThe platform acknowledges critical risk vectors in DeFi environments. Smart-contract risk is ever-present due to vulnerabilities in underlying protocols. To mitigate this, the platform will only allocate funds to audited protocols with multi-year operational histories, alongside an internal review of codebases before any integration.\n\nOracle risk arises from potential price feed manipulations or downtime. To reduce this risk, the platform will implement a multi-source validation mechanism, combining Chainlink, Pyth, and in-house anomaly detection to cross-verify price and rate data before executing sensitive transactions.\n\nLiquidity risk, particularly from unstable or thinly traded pools, poses another threat. The platform will enforce strict minimum liquidity thresholds before allocating capital to any farm or pool. Additionally, dynamic liquidity monitoring will trigger early withdrawal mechanisms to protect users in deteriorating liquidity scenarios.\n\nMulti-Chain Roadmap\n\nThe multi-chain expansion strategy is designed to maximize TVL growth while maintaining platform integrity. Phase one will focus on a successful Ethereum mainnet launch scheduled for August 2025, establishing strong liquidity partnerships and protocol integrations. Phase two will expand to Binance Smart Chain (BSC) by November 2025, leveraging its low transaction costs and growing DeFi ecosystem. Finally, support for Polygon is targeted for January 2026, capitalizing on its scalability, affordable gas fees, and active yield farming community. Each expansion phase will involve separate smart contract deployments, adapted yield strategies per chain, and chain-specific optimizations to maintain performance and security standards.\n\nKey Milestones\n\t1.\tPlatform MVP launch on Ethereum mainnet – August 30, 2025\n\t2.\tFull integration of Risk Oracle and dynamic vault rebalancing – October 15, 2025\n\t3.\tMulti-chain expansion to Binance Smart Chain – November 30, 2025\n\t4.\tPlatform launch on Polygon with optimized L2 strategies – January 20, 2026\n\t5.\tAchievement of $50M TVL across supported chains – March 31, 2026",
