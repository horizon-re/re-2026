  "text": "Executive Summary\n\nWe are pleased to submit our proposal in response to your RFP for a next-generation financial reconciliation and ledger solution. Our platform is purpose-built to deliver real-time accuracy, auditability, and operational resilience, leveraging a scalable technical foundation and an AI-driven reconciliation engine.\nOur mission is to empower your organization with transparent, compliant, and automated financial operations, supporting sustainable growth and regulatory readiness. With extensive experience in financial systems, cloud-native infrastructure, and secure data management, we are confident in our ability to exceed your performance, compliance, and service expectations.\n\nCompliance & Certifications\n\nSOC 2 Type II Compliance\n\nOur platform is audited annually under the American Institute of CPAs’ (AICPA) SOC 2 Type II standards, covering the Trust Services Criteria of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Our 2025 audit scope includes all production systems, client data flows, access controls, change management processes, and incident response mechanisms.\n\nISO 27001 Certification\n\nWe maintain full ISO 27001 certification across our infrastructure, policies, and procedures, certified by an accredited third-party auditor. Our ISO 27001 scope encompasses cloud hosting environments, physical office security, endpoint management, and data governance.\n\nAudit Cadence\n\nWe undergo independent external audits on the following cadence:\n\t•\tSOC 2 Type II: Annually\n\t•\tISO 27001 Surveillance: Annually\n\t•\tISO 27001 Recertification: Every three years\nInternal control self-assessments are conducted quarterly, supplemented by semi-annual penetration tests performed by CREST-certified vendors.\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\nReal-Time Ledger Design\n\nOur ledger engine is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency transaction ingestion.\nKey features include:\n\t•\tDouble-entry accounting model ensuring atomicity and immutability.\n\t•\tPartitioned transaction journals for scalability and isolation across clients.\n\t•\tMulti-version concurrency control (MVCC) to enable parallel reads and writes without locks.\nLedger data is persisted to a cloud-native relational database with strong ACID guarantees.\n\nFailover Clusters\n\nThe system operates in an active-active cluster model across two distinct cloud availability zones per region, with automatic failover triggered within 30 seconds upon detection of node or zone failures.\nDisaster Recovery (DR) readiness is ensured via:\n\t•\tHourly snapshots of ledger state.\n\t•\tWarm standby region maintained at 80% capacity, located geographically distant from the primary region.\n\nData Retention Policies\n\nTransaction data, audit trails, and reconciliation records are retained for a minimum of 7 years, configurable up to 10 years based on client-specific compliance requirements.\nData is encrypted at rest with AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.3. End-of-retention deletions follow GDPR and CCPA-compliant workflows, including secure erasure verification logs.\n\nAI Reconciliation Engine\n\nData Model\n\nThe reconciliation engine ingests structured financial events into a normalized data schema encompassing transactional metadata, entity identifiers, reference fields, and reconciliation status.\nThe model supports:\n\t•\tMulti-ledger reconciliation (e.g., payment processor vs. bank settlement ledger).\n\t•\tHierarchical mapping for nested transactions (e.g., payouts containing sub-transactions).\n\t•\tCustom reconciliation rules definable per client.\n\nReconciliation SLA\n\t•\tMatch Rate: ≥ 99.5% within 4 hours of transaction ingestion.\n\t•\tDiscrepancy Resolution SLA: Flagging and auto-triage within 15 minutes of mismatch detection.\n\nAnomaly Detection\n\nThe AI engine utilizes:\n\t•\tTime-series forecasting models to predict expected volume and value trends.\n\t•\tUnsupervised clustering to detect novel transaction patterns indicative of fraud, operational errors, or reconciliation drift.\nAnomalies are scored based on confidence thresholds and escalated via automated alerts and ticket generation.\n\nImplementation Plan\n\nPhase 1 – Discovery & Design (Weeks 1–4)\n\t•\tRequirements workshops\n\t•\tSystem design specification finalization\n\t•\tIntegration planning with existing systems\n\nPhase 2 – Core System Setup (Weeks 5–8)\n\t•\tCloud environment provisioning\n\t•\tLedger engine and reconciliation modules deployment\n\t•\tConnectivity to external data sources and APIs\n\nPhase 3 – Validation & Testing (Weeks 9–11)\n\t•\tLedger validation using synthetic transaction sets\n\t•\tReconciliation engine pilot with historical data\n\t•\tUAT execution with client stakeholders\n\nPhase 4 – Cutover & Launch (Week 12)\n\t•\tCutover dry-run exercises\n\t•\tProduction cutover to live systems\n\t•\tHypercare support activation\n\nResources\n\t•\tProject Manager (full time)\n\t•\tLead Solution Architect (part time)\n\t•\tTwo Backend Engineers (full time)\n\t•\tQA Specialist (full time)\n\t•\tClient Success Manager (part time)\n\nPricing Model\n\nLicensing\n\nA base platform license of $6,000 per month covers access to the ledger system, reconciliation engine, and reporting modules. License includes up to 5 million monthly transactions.\n\nPer-Transaction Fees\n\t•\tTransactions exceeding 5 million/month incur an additional $0.0012 per transaction.\n\t•\tAnomalous transaction reviews beyond SLA thresholds (client-requested investigations) incur $0.50 per item.\n\nSupport Tiers\n\t•\tStandard Support (included):\n\t•\t8x5 business hours\n\t•\t24-hour initial response time for non-critical tickets\n\t•\tPremium Support (+$2,000/month):\n\t•\t24x7 coverage\n\t•\t1-hour response for critical tickets\n\t•\tDedicated Technical Account Manager\n\t•\tEnterprise Support (custom quote):\n\t•\tSLA-backed commitments\n\t•\tOnsite escalation paths\n\t•\tQuarterly solution reviews",
