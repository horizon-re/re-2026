  "text": "Feature Request: JSON Integration with ClearScan.ai\nContext\nClearScan.ai, a key integration partner, is transitioning from XML to JSON for all invoice data exchanges and requires InvoiceBuddy’s immediate adoption of a JSON endpoint. Finance stakeholders also want AI-driven field tagging (vendor, tax, due-date), while operations is concerned about meeting a 200 requests/minute SLA given ClearScan’s volume of ~10 million invoices per month and projected 3× growth next quarter.\nSample JSON\nFor example, a JSON response payload may look like the following (one value is null): { \"vendor\": \"ACME Corp\", \"due_date\": null, \"tax\": 125.00, \"tag_confidence\": 0.98 }\nRequirements\nSupport OCR parsing of invoice content (extract text and key fields from scans).\nInclude a tag_confidence field as a float, indicating the AI tagging confidence score.\nEnsure the API supports a sustained 200 requests/minute throughput (SLA requirement).\nUse JWT for authentication and AES-256 encryption at rest to secure all data.\nAI Stretch\nConsider implementing UNSPSC code tagging at the line-item level as a future AI-driven enhancement to meet the board’s request for standardized item classification.
