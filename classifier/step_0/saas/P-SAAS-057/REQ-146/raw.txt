**Incident Ticket #7432 – CloudWatch Anomaly & Spend Spike**  
**Priority:** P1 | **Reported by:** AWS Budgets | **Triggered:** PagerDuty

At 02:13 UTC, CloudWatch reported an anomalous spend spike from $0 to $1,000,000 within 2 minutes. Associated metric value returned as `NaN`, suggesting a divide-by-zero or corrupted calculation in cost reporting pipeline. AWS Budgets alert triggered, automatically escalating via PagerDuty (P1). Immediate remediation required:

- Fallback logic must replace `NaN` with last known valid datapoint.  
- Mark `NaN` entries as null in audit logs.  
- Engineering to deliver root-cause analysis within 4 hours.  
- Mandatory unit test to simulate divide-by-zero scenario and validate safeguard logic.

This anomaly caused temporary billing visibility loss and alerting system overload. Until resolved, all dependent financial dashboards and budget alerts are considered unreliable. Engineering lead assigned: @cloud-metrics-eng. ETA for preliminary RCA: 06:30 UTC.
