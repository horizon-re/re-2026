  "text": "Meeting MinutesThis document serves as a concise record of the key outcomes from the standup meeting, focusing on decisions made, action items assigned, and identified next steps. The information captured aims to provide clarity and ensure accountability for the tasks discussed. Standard meeting minutes typically include a summary of discussions, decisions, and assigned responsibilities.1 This record prioritizes these elements to provide an efficient overview of the meeting's actionable results.DecisionsDuring the standup, a consensus was reached regarding the approach to role management within the system. It was decided that custom roles will be implemented to provide greater flexibility and granularity in access control. Furthermore, the meeting addressed and clarified the rules governing inheritance for these roles, ensuring a clear understanding of how permissions will be propagated throughout the system. Documenting decisions is a fundamental aspect of meeting minutes, providing a reference point for future actions and ensuring everyone is aligned on the agreed-upon outcomes.1Action ItemsFollowing the discussions, specific tasks were assigned to team members to drive progress on the identified areas. The following action items were agreed upon:\nDefine the role hierarchy within Confluence. This task is assigned to @alice, who will be responsible for outlining the structure and relationships between the different custom roles. Clearly defined action items with assigned owners are crucial for ensuring accountability and tracking progress.1\nImplement the inheritance rules within the Auth service. This responsibility lies with @bob, who will translate the clarified inheritance model into functional code within the authentication system. Assigning ownership ensures that each task has a dedicated individual responsible for its completion.2\nNext StepsTo further advance the work on role management and ensure its alignment with overall security policies, the following next steps were identified:\nSchedule a policy review. This review will involve relevant stakeholders to ensure the implemented custom roles and inheritance rules adhere to the organization's broader security and compliance requirements. Identifying next steps in meeting minutes helps to maintain momentum and plan future activities.1\nUpdate documentation. Comprehensive documentation of the new custom roles and inheritance model will be necessary to ensure clarity for all users and administrators of the system. This step is crucial for knowledge sharing and long-term maintainability.1",
