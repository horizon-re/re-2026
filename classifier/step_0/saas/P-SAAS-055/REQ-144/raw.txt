The system shall support logging events in Mars Coordinated Time (MTC), such as "Booting in MARS-TZ (sol 0)", by mapping MTC to its corresponding Earth UTC offset using the `martian_tz_map` table; if no valid mapping exists, the system shall raise an alert. All extraterrestrial MTC-based log entries shall be stored in the `logs_mars` partition with a strict retention policy of seven Earth days. Additionally, the system shall integrate with Grafana to include a dashboard panel labeled “Mars Sol Lag” to visualize time synchronization discrepancies between Earth UTC and MTC.
