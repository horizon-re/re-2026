SEV-1 Alert: “epoch overflow 2038-01-19 03:14:08” triggered critical time_t failure. All engineers: immediately rollback to build v2.7.3 across all regions using `ci-hotfix.sh`. Mitigation SLA: pipelines must be green within 15 minutes. An epoch-safe patch must be cut and validated by EOD. Create a post-mortem ticket with root-cause analysis and include a regression test explicitly covering `time_t >= INT32_MAX`. No exceptions—this needs airtight verification.
