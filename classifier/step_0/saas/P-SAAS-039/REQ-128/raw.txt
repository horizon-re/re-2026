Please implement exponential backoff logic (1s, 2s, 4s, up to 5 attempts) for all failed payment webhook deliveries. Each retry must verify the HMAC-SHA256 signature header to ensure authenticity before processing. Every attempt, regardless of outcome, should be logged in the webhook_retry_history table with the status (success/failure) and corresponding response code. Additionally, the delivery process must meet an SLA of achieving successful delivery within 2 minutes at the 95th percentile (P95). Kindly provide the expected Go-live date for this change and share a testing sandbox URL so we can validate the implementation before launch. Thank you!
