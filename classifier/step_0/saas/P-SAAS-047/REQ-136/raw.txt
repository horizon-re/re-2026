**Feasibility Study: Secure Sharing with Verifiable Logs**

### **Objective – Secure Sharing with Verifiable Logs**

This feasibility study explores the development and deployment of a secure data-sharing system with verifiable audit logs, tailored to highly regulated environments. The primary objective is to enable entities (e.g., enterprises, healthcare providers, government agencies) to share sensitive data across organizational boundaries without compromising confidentiality, integrity, or regulatory compliance. The solution ensures that:

- Data is encrypted before leaving the client’s environment.
- Access and sharing actions are logged in a tamper-proof manner.
- Regulatory frameworks such as GDPR are upheld.
- Stakeholders retain cryptographic proof of compliance activities.

### **Encryption Model – Client-Side AES-GCM with Key Escrow via KMS-Backed HSM**

To ensure end-to-end confidentiality, all data is encrypted on the client side using **AES-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode)** before transmission or storage. This authenticated encryption algorithm ensures both data confidentiality and integrity, guarding against unauthorized access and tampering.

Key characteristics of the encryption model include:

- **Client-side encryption**: Data is encrypted before it leaves the user’s device or service boundary.
- **AES-GCM**: Offers authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD), ensuring integrity in transit and at rest.
- **Key Management**: Keys are not stored with the data. Instead, they are escrowed via a **cloud-based Key Management Service (KMS)** integrated with **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)** for secure generation, rotation, and access control.
- **Access Control Policies**: Access to the keys is governed by strict Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and time-based constraints.
- **Auditability**: Every key retrieval attempt is logged and monitored within the KMS system.

This model effectively mitigates the risks of insider threats, data breaches, and unauthorized key access.

### **Blockchain Logging – Append-Only Hash to Hyperledger; On-Chain Proof Every 10 Minutes**

For verifiable, tamper-evident logging of data-sharing events, an **append-only audit trail** is constructed using a **Hyperledger Fabric** blockchain network. This system logs cryptographic hashes of metadata related to each data-sharing operation.

**Mechanics of the logging model:**

- **Off-chain event processing**: Every data-sharing event (including metadata like sender, recipient, and timestamp) is hashed (e.g., SHA-256) and temporarily stored in an event buffer.
- **Hash chaining**: Events are grouped and sequentially hashed to form a Merkle tree.
- **On-chain commitment**: Every **10 minutes**, a Merkle root representing the last batch of events is written to the blockchain.
- **Hyperledger Fabric**: Chosen for its enterprise readiness, fine-grained access controls, and support for private channels between consortium members.
- **Auditability**: Any external auditor or regulatory authority can verify an event’s inclusion by validating the Merkle proof against the on-chain hash.

This ensures non-repudiation, tamper evidence, and cryptographic traceability for all shared events.

### **GDPR Alignment – Right-to-Erasure via Off-Chain Pointer Deletion; Article 30 Mapping**

The solution is engineered to comply with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, focusing on data subject rights and controller obligations.

**Key Compliance Mechanisms:**

- **Right-to-Erasure**: Although the system maintains immutable logs on-chain, actual data is never stored on the blockchain. Instead:
  - All personally identifiable information (PII) resides off-chain in encrypted form.
  - On-chain entries merely reference **pseudonymous pointers** or **non-PII metadata**.
  - When a right-to-erasure request is granted, the corresponding off-chain data and its reference pointer are deleted. This ensures data is no longer accessible or re-identifiable, satisfying Article 17 obligations.

- **Article 30 Mapping (Records of Processing Activities)**:
  - The system automatically logs data processing activities (who shared what, when, and with whom).
  - These logs can be exported in a structured format to facilitate compliance audits.

- **Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation**:
  - Only metadata essential for compliance is retained.
  - Data sharing is purpose-bound and access-controlled.

This hybrid on/off-chain architecture supports both GDPR-compliant data deletion and audit integrity.

### **Cost-Benefit Analysis – Infra Cost vs Compliance Gains**

#### **Costs:**

- **Cloud Infrastructure**:
  - Encrypted object storage (e.g., Amazon S3, Azure Blob).
  - HSM-backed KMS usage charges (per key, per operation).
  - Blockchain node hosting and inter-peer communication (compute and bandwidth).

- **Development and Integration**:
  - Initial setup of encryption and logging modules.
  - Smart contract development and Hyperledger deployment.
  - IAM, GDPR compliance tooling, and auditing dashboards.

- **Ongoing Maintenance**:
  - Key lifecycle management.
  - Blockchain network updates.
  - Compliance updates for evolving regulations.

Estimated infrastructure cost: $5,000–$8,000/month for a medium-sized enterprise setup.

#### **Benefits:**

- **Regulatory Assurance**:
  - Native GDPR compliance mechanisms reduce audit overhead.
  - Automated Article 30 documentation streamlines regulator communication.

- **Operational Integrity**:
  - Zero-trust design and immutable audit logs reduce insider threat exposure.
  - Easier dispute resolution with on-chain cryptographic proof.

- **Market Differentiation**:
  - Transparent data handling practices enhance customer trust and competitive advantage.

- **Long-Term Savings**:
  - Reduced risk of non-compliance fines (up to €20M or 4% of global turnover under GDPR).
  - Minimized cost of incident response due to verifiable audit trail.

Overall, the long-term **compliance assurance and reputational gains** significantly outweigh the moderate recurring infrastructure cost.

### **Conclusion**

This feasibility study confirms that a secure sharing framework incorporating **client-side AES-GCM encryption**, **KMS-backed key escrow**, **Hyperledger-based logging**, and **GDPR-aligned controls** is both technically and economically viable. The solution addresses core challenges in secure data exchange—confidentiality, auditability, and compliance—while offering scalable deployment options and tangible risk mitigation for privacy-centric organizations.
