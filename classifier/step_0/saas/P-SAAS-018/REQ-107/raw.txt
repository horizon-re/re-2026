UX Requirements DocumentPain PointsCurrent user experience suffers from desktop-centric flows, creating difficulties for mobile users. Slow load times across the platform lead to user frustration and potential abandonment. Furthermore, the confusing user interface hinders task completion and overall satisfaction. These issues collectively contribute to a suboptimal user experience, particularly on mobile devices, where users expect intuitive and efficient interactions. Addressing these pain points is crucial for improving user engagement and achieving business goals.1Mobile-First FlowsTo enhance the mobile user experience, the implementation of mobile-first flows is required. This includes a streamlined one-tap registration process to minimize friction during onboarding. A progress indicator should be incorporated to provide users with clear feedback during multi-step processes. Inline validation on forms will help users identify and correct errors in real-time, improving efficiency and reducing frustration. These features are essential for meeting the expectations of modern mobile users.2Performance TargetsCritical performance targets must be met to ensure a responsive and efficient user experience. The initial screen load time should be less than 1 second to minimize user wait times and improve perceived performance. Tap response time should be under 100 milliseconds to provide immediate feedback and create a fluid interactive experience. Achieving these targets is vital for user satisfaction and retention.1AccessibilityAccessibility requirements are paramount to ensure inclusivity. All interactive elements must have large touch targets to accommodate users with motor impairments and improve usability on smaller screens. The user interface must also adhere to WCAG AA color contrast guidelines to ensure readability for users with visual impairments. Meeting these accessibility standards is essential for creating a product that is usable by everyone.3
