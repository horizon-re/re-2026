Please prioritize immediate rollout of consent tracking and one-click opt-out automation to meet CCPA compliance requirements. The deadline for full deployment is 48 hours from now. As part of this rollout, ensure an audit-ready log is maintained for all consent changes, capturing user ID, timestamp, and source IP for each event. Additionally, set up a nightly export of these logs to the designated S3 bucket ccpa-audit-logs, encrypted using AES-256. Please confirm the assigned development owner responsible for this rollout and provide a rollback plan in case any deployment issues arise. Immediate acknowledgment is required.
