Subject: Regarding your Subscription Cancellation

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out to us. We sincerely apologize for any frustration you've experienced with our subscription cancellation process. We understand that a smooth and easy cancellation experience is important, and we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

We're happy to inform you that we've recently implemented a new, streamlined one-click cancellation flow within your billing portal. To cancel your subscription, simply log in to your account and navigate to the billing section. You should now see a clear and direct option to cancel your current plan.

Once you initiate the cancellation, you will receive both an email and an SMS confirmation within the next five minutes to confirm that your request has been successfully processed.

For our internal analysis and to help us improve our services, we will also record the reason for your cancellation. We value your feedback and may reach out separately to gather more details about your experience.

If you happen to change your mind at any point, we would be grateful if you could take a moment to complete this quick survey about your cancellation experience: [Link to Survey]. Your feedback is invaluable to us.

Thank you for being a valued customer. If you have any further questions or require any assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.

Sincerely,

The [Your Company Name] Support Team
