Implement real-time synchronization of warehouse inventory data every 5 seconds across all locations, with a mandatory fallback queuing mechanism if API latency exceeds 1 second, ensuring bulk catch-up synchronization within 30 seconds; discrepancies of more than 10 units must be logged to the inv_sync_errors table and immediately trigger a PagerDuty alert; this requirement is not negotiable and must be fully rolled out and operational by the end of the current sprint.
