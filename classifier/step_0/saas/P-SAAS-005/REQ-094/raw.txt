Subscription & Tier ManagementThe platform must provide comprehensive capabilities for managing various subscription plans and their associated tiers, allowing businesses to structure their offerings in a flexible and scalable manner.The platform should enable administrators to create and manage a diverse range of subscription plans, each identified by a unique name, a detailed description outlining its benefits, and a selectable billing frequency, such as monthly, quarterly, or annual cycles. Furthermore, the system must accommodate different pricing models to suit various service offerings, including flat-rate pricing where a fixed fee is charged per billing cycle, usage-based pricing where charges are directly proportional to the consumption of services, and tiered pricing where different usage levels or feature sets are offered at varying price points.11 A fundamental requirement is the ability to associate a base price with each subscription plan and to define clear and configurable rules for the automatic generation of recurring billing charges.7 The flexibility in defining these pricing models is paramount for catering to the diverse needs of B2B interactions and for aligning with different revenue generation strategies. The platform’s underlying architecture should be designed to easily accommodate the creation of new pricing models and the modification of existing ones as business needs evolve.Each subscription plan and its constituent tiers must have clearly defined entitlements, which specify the exact features and usage limitations granted to subscribers. These entitlements can encompass a wide array of aspects, such as access to specific software functionalities (often referred to as feature gates), allocated storage capacity, the permissible number of API calls, the number of user seats allowed under the subscription, or the level of technical support provided.3 The platform must include a robust mechanism for administrators to define, meticulously track, and rigorously enforce these entitlements for each individual subscriber throughout their subscription lifecycle.3 Effective entitlement management is not only crucial for delivering the contracted services but also plays a significant role in safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring appropriate resource utilization within the platform.The platform must facilitate seamless and intuitive upgrade and downgrade processes for subscribers. Users should have the ability to modify their current subscription plan or tier at any point during their active billing cycle.14 When a plan change occurs, the system must automatically calculate and apply any necessary pro-rated charges or credits to the subscriber's account to reflect the partial billing periods. Upon the successful completion of an upgrade or downgrade, the system should generate and send timely notifications to both the subscriber and the platform administrator, ensuring transparency and keeping all relevant parties informed. A smooth and user-friendly upgrade/downgrade experience is vital for maintaining customer satisfaction and fostering long-term retention, as it empowers businesses to adapt their subscriptions in response to their changing operational requirements without undue complexity.To support customer acquisition and platform adoption, the platform should offer comprehensive free trial management capabilities for various subscription plans. Administrators should have the flexibility to configure key aspects of the free trial, such as its duration, the specific features that are accessible during the trial period, and whether or not credit card details are required from the user at the outset.15 The system should automatically send timely reminders to users as their free trial period is nearing its end, encouraging conversion to a paid subscription. Furthermore, a clear and straightforward process must be in place to seamlessly transition free trial users to paid subscribers upon their decision to continue using the platform.17 Effective management of free trials, incorporating elements like clear expectations and proactive engagement, is a proven strategy for B2B SaaS businesses to attract and convert potential customers.Plan NameTierFeatures IncludedUsage Limits (e.g., API Calls, Storage)PriceBilling FrequencyBasic-Feature A, Feature B100 API Calls, 1 GB Storage$10.00MonthlyProStandardFeature A, Feature B, Feature C500 API Calls, 10 GB Storage$50.00MonthlyProPremiumFeature A, Feature B, Feature C, Feature D1000 API Calls, 50 GB Storage$100.00MonthlyEnterprise-All Features, Dedicated SupportUnlimitedCustomAnnually3. Dynamic Usage MeteringThe platform must possess robust capabilities for dynamically measuring and recording the consumption of services by subscribers, enabling flexible and accurate usage-based billing models.A fundamental requirement is the platform's ability to collect a variety of usage metrics that accurately reflect the consumption of services by subscribers.4 This metric collection should be highly configurable and easily extensible to accommodate a wide range of usage types, including but not limited to the number of API calls made, the volume of data stored, the amount of processing time utilized, and the number of transactions processed.4 The underlying data collection mechanisms must be inherently reliable and ensure a high degree of accuracy to guarantee fair and transparent billing practices.4 The platform's design should allow for the seamless integration of new metrics as the service offerings evolve, without requiring significant modifications to the core system.The platform should provide the flexibility to define different aggregation intervals for the collected usage metrics, such as hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly.5 The ability to configure these aggregation intervals on a per-metric and per-subscription plan basis is essential. The system must then accurately aggregate the recorded usage data over these specified intervals to facilitate precise billing calculations.5 This configurability allows the platform to adapt to various billing scenarios, where some services might be billed based on short-term, high-intensity usage, while others are based on cumulative consumption over longer periods.To enhance transparency and empower subscribers to manage their usage effectively, the platform must support the configuration of threshold alerts for the defined usage metrics.6 Subscribers should have the ability to set up personalized alerts that notify them when their usage approaches or exceeds predefined limits. These alerts should be highly configurable, allowing for the specification of different threshold levels (e.g., 50%, 80%, 100% of the limit) and preferred notification methods, such as email or in-app messages. Additionally, the platform should be capable of generating alerts for administrators in response to unusual usage patterns that might indicate potential system issues or fraudulent activity. Proactive threshold alerts not only improve the customer experience by preventing unexpected charges but also provide valuable insights into service consumption patterns.Metric NameDescriptionUnit of MeasurementAggregation IntervalAPI CallsNumber of successful requests made to the platform APICountMonthlyData StorageTotal amount of data stored by the accountGigabytes (GB)DailyCompute TimeTotal CPU time utilized by the accountMinutesHourlyNumber of UsersNumber of active users on the account in a given monthCountMonthlyTransactions ProcessedNumber of successful transactions processed by the accountCountMonthly4. Automated InvoicingThe platform must incorporate robust features for the automated generation and delivery of invoices, streamlining the billing cycle and reducing manual effort.The platform should support the automated generation of invoices based on highly configurable schedules, such as monthly or quarterly cycles, or triggered by specific events like reaching a predefined usage threshold.19 Different billing frequencies should be supported to align with the various subscription plans offered. Furthermore, the system must provide the capability to generate ad-hoc invoices whenever necessary, such as for one-time charges or adjustments. Automating the invoice generation process significantly reduces the administrative burden and minimizes the potential for human errors associated with manual processing.7 This ensures timely and accurate billing, contributing to improved cash flow management.All invoices generated by the platform must be in Portable Document Format (PDF) to ensure easy sharing, printing, and a consistent professional appearance.21 The PDF format of the invoice should include all essential billing information, such as the specific billing period covered, a clear and itemized list of the services rendered or the usage incurred, the corresponding quantities or durations, the unit prices for each item, the total amount due, the applicable payment terms, and the complete contact details for both the customer and the vendor.22 The platform should also allow for a degree of customization of the invoice template, enabling businesses to incorporate their company branding elements, such as logos, to maintain a consistent brand identity across all customer communications. A well-formatted and professional-looking invoice enhances the company's credibility and facilitates clearer communication with business clients.The platform must support multiple channels for the delivery of invoices to customers, including electronic mail (email) and the option for customers to directly download their invoices from a secure self-service portal.23 For email delivery, the system should offer configurable options for sending invoices either as direct attachments or as secure links to the invoice document. To ensure reliable delivery, the platform should track delivery confirmations whenever possible. Providing multiple delivery channels caters to the preferences of different customers and ensures that invoices are received promptly. A self-service portal empowers customers to access their billing history and current invoices at their convenience, reducing the need for direct inquiries and improving overall customer satisfaction.5.

The system should automatically convert prices from the base currency to the customer's selected currency based on predefined exchange rates.29 To ensure accuracy, the platform should allow for the configuration of rules governing the update of these exchange rates, such as setting a frequency for updates (e.g., daily) or integrating with specific third-party exchange rate providers.31 Supporting multi-currency billing is essential for businesses with a global customer base, as it simplifies international transactions and enhances the customer experience.The platform should accommodate different locale formats for the display of dates, numbers, and currencies based on the customer's geographical region.8 These locale settings should be configurable at the individual customer account level. All customer-facing documents generated by the platform, including invoice PDFs, should automatically adhere to the locale format selected by the customer. This includes displaying dates in the correct order and format, using appropriate decimal and thousands separators for numbers, and presenting currency symbols in the correct position and format.35 Providing localization support ensures that customers see billing information in a format that is familiar and easily understandable to them, improving the overall user experience.The platform must accurately calculate applicable taxes based on the customer's location and the relevant tax regulations, such as Value Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST).25 This requires the ability to configure different tax rates and rules for various geographical regions and jurisdictions. The system should automatically determine the correct tax rates based on the customer's billing address and apply these taxes to the invoice total. Furthermore, the platform should provide support for handling tax exemptions, including the ability to manage and validate tax exemption certificates provided by customers.25 Accurate tax calculation and adherence to local tax laws are critical for B2B transactions, especially in international commerce, to ensure compliance and avoid potential legal issues.6. Fraud DetectionThe platform must incorporate robust mechanisms for detecting and mitigating fraudulent activities, ensuring the security and integrity of the billing process.The platform should implement anomaly detection logic to proactively identify potentially fraudulent activities within the system.9 This logic should involve the continuous monitoring of various parameters and the identification of unusual patterns or deviations from expected behavior, such as significant increases in transaction volumes, inconsistencies between billing addresses and IP addresses, multiple consecutive failed payment attempts, or unauthorized modifications to account details.37 The platform should ideally leverage machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can learn from historical data and identify subtle indicators of fraudulent behavior.40 This proactive approach to fraud detection is crucial for minimizing financial losses and protecting both the platform and its legitimate users from malicious activities.Upon the detection of a potential anomaly, the platform must generate timely alerts.9 These alerts should be configurable to be sent to designated platform administrators and, depending on the nature of the anomaly, potentially to the affected customer as well. The system should support different severity levels for alerts, allowing administrators to prioritize investigations based on the perceived risk associated with the flagged activity. Prompt and informative alerts are essential for enabling administrators to take immediate action to investigate and address suspicious events.The platform should provide well-defined workflows and tools to facilitate the investigation of potentially fraudulent activities.48 This includes providing administrators with access to detailed transaction histories, comprehensive user activity logs, and relevant payment information associated with the flagged anomaly. The system should also allow administrators to take necessary actions, such as marking transactions or accounts as fraudulent, temporarily suspending user accounts, or reversing suspicious transactions. Maintaining a comprehensive audit trail of all investigation activities is crucial for compliance and for learning from past incidents to improve the effectiveness of the fraud detection mechanisms over time. A structured approach to investigation ensures that potential fraud is handled efficiently and consistently.7. Reporting & Analytics APIThe platform must provide a comprehensive Reporting & Analytics API that allows authorized users to access valuable data insights for business analysis and decision-making.The API should include dedicated endpoints for retrieving various revenue reports, such as total revenue generated over specific periods, detailed breakdowns of recurring revenue (MRR), revenue generated by different subscription plans, and trends in revenue growth over time.10 These endpoints should support flexible filtering options, allowing users to narrow down the data based on specific date ranges, selected subscription plans, defined customer segments, and transaction currency. Access to detailed revenue data through the API is critical for understanding the financial performance of the platform and for informing strategic business decisions.The API should also provide endpoints for accessing usage summaries for individual subscribers, allowing users to view their consumption of various platform metrics over different timeframes.56 These endpoints should support filtering by specific customer accounts, selected subscription plans, and defined date ranges. The returned usage summaries should include aggregated consumption data for the relevant metrics and should ideally highlight any instances where a subscriber's usage has exceeded predefined thresholds.4 Providing usage data through the API enables both the platform provider and the subscribers to gain valuable insights into service consumption patterns, facilitating better resource management and potentially identifying opportunities for plan upgrades.To enhance the utility of the reporting API, it must support the export of report data in several common formats, including Comma Separated Values (CSV), Microsoft Excel (XLS/XLSX), and potentially JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).57 This flexibility allows users to analyze the data using their preferred external tools and to seamlessly integrate the billing data with other internal business systems.1 The API must ensure the integrity and security of the data throughout the export process. Supporting multiple export formats ensures that the reporting API is accessible and useful to a wide range of users with varying technical capabilities and data analysis preferences.
