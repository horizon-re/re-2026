**Ticket Title:** OCR Misinterpretation of "5 s" as "$5" Leading to Price Calculation Error

**Description:**  
Our OCR system is incorrectly interpreting the string "5 s" (representing "5 seconds") as "$5", leading to miscalculations in price-sensitive contexts where time-based data is critical. This is especially problematic in automated billing and log analysis pipelines where time and currency are both present, creating ambiguities.

**Tasks:**  
1. **Implement contextual spell-checking logic** that distinguishes between time units (e.g., "s", "sec", "seconds") and monetary values (e.g., "$", "USD", etc.). This should rely on surrounding words and common patterns to infer the correct unit.
2. **Introduce a manual review flag** for any extracted value where time and currency indicators are mixed or ambiguous (e.g., "$5s", "5 $s", etc.).
3. **Update the OCR post-processing pipeline** to apply this logic before final value extraction is returned downstream.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- System must correctly identify "5 s" as time when used in timing or duration context.
- No false positive currency values should result from timing strings.
- All flagged ambiguities should appear in the review dashboard with context snippet and original OCR output.
