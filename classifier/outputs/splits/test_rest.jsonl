soft-deleted records.40 Managing unique data constraints becomes more complex with soft deletion, as records marked as deleted might still violate uniqueness constraints when new, similar records are created.33 Solutions to this include using partial indexing in the database or incorporating the soft delete marker (e.g., the timestamp) into the unique key definition.33 Soft deletion can also lead to potential performance issues due to increased table sizes and the inclusion of deleted records in indexes, although filtered indexes can help address this.38", "Moreover, the implementation of soft delete often requires revisiting standard database and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) features to ensure they correctly handle logically deleted records.33 Finally, there is a risk of data leaks if developers inadvertently forget to apply the necessary filters, leading to soft-deleted data being exposed in the application.33 Successful implementation of soft delete necessitates careful consideration of database support for handling unique keys in the context of soft deletion, robust application-level support for consistently filtering out deleted records, and a thorough review of how standard database APIs are used throughout the application.335.2 Hard Delete:Hard deletion refers to the process of permanently removing records from the database, rendering the data irrecoverable

how related data will be handled.33 Organizations must also ensure that their hard deletion processes align with compliance requirements for permanent data erasure, such as those stipulated by GDPR.38 Given the irreversible nature of hard deletion, it is often prudent to maintain an audit log or archive of the deleted records, especially if there is a potential need for historical reference or compliance verification.39", "In situations where soft deletion was previously employed, organizations need to consider how hard deletion will interact with any unique key constraints that might still

will provide an alternative way to visualize data distributions, smoothing out noise to reveal underlying patterns.17 To illustrate the composition of data, pie charts, doughnut charts, stacked bar charts, stacked area charts, treemaps, and sunburst charts will be included, ideal for showing parts of a whole and their relative proportions, such as market share or budget allocation.15 For visualizing relationships between variables, scatter plots and bubble charts will be supported, with bubble charts extending scatter plots by representing a third numeric variable through bubble size.15 Specialized chart types such as funnel charts for visualizing sequential processes, heatmaps for identifying patterns in large datasets, maps for geographical data, gauges for showing performance against a target, and sparklines for concise trend representations will also be available.20 Additionally, dual-axis charts will be considered for comparing different metrics with potentially different scales on a single visualization.17Drill-down functionality will be a key interactive feature, enabling users to explore data in greater depth.28"], "pipeline_label":

containers.68", "The platform should provide clear visual indicators of where permissions are inherited from and offer administrators intuitive controls for managing these inheritance settings.68
