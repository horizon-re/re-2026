"context_before": ["Biometric authentication, such as fingerprint scanning or facial recognition, and digital keys stored on smartphones can prevent unauthorized physical access to vehicles.55 Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification before granting access.45 Digital certificates and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) are fundamental for establishing the identity of devices and encrypting communication within the connected vehicle ecosystem.58 Digital certificates function as virtual ID cards, verifying the identity of users, devices, or entities in digital interactions, while PKI provides the framework for managing and distributing these certificates.58 This ensures that only authorized devices and software can communicate with the vehicle, preventing unauthorized access and control.58 Proper device identity management is particularly important for mobility services like car-sharing, as it helps protect the personal data of users and reduces the risk of data breaches.55 By securely identifying and authenticating both the user and the device, manufacturers can minimize the risk of fraud and unauthorized vehicle access.57Compliance with data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States is essential for any fleet management system that collects personal data.61", "These regulations mandate transparency regarding the types of data collected, the purposes for which it is collected, and how it is used.61 Organizations must obtain explicit consent from drivers and other data subjects before collecting any personal information and clearly communicate how this data will be processed and protected.61 Implementing robust security measures is crucial, including encrypting data both during storage and transmission to protect it from unauthorized access and potential breaches.61 Access to sensitive data should be limited to authorized personnel only, using role-based access controls.61 Regular audits of data collection, storage, and processing practices should be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance with privacy regulations.61 Adhering to the principle of data minimization, which involves collecting only the essential data necessary for operations, helps reduce the potential exposure of personal information.61 Establishing clear data retention policies that specify how long data will be stored and when it will be securely disposed of is also a critical aspect of GDPR and CCPA compliance.61 Transparency and accountability are paramount, requiring organizations to be upfront and honest with individuals about how their personal data is being handled.62Securing", "OTA software updates using digital signatures is a fundamental security practice.", "Every OTA update should be digitally signed by the vehicle manufacturer or a trusted
