When the player enters each room, she shall be given the short names of each artefacts found there (�there is each short bow, each cloth bag and each red gem here)�. If she looks only at each object specifically (�look gem�) the detailed description shall be given. The detailed description shall be empty, in which case the user shall get each message such as �it is each ordinary red gem�. each type each artifact shall be one of: food; weapon; treasure; tool, thing. Food shall be eaten to gain strength, weapons shall be wielded to improve fighting ability, treasure adds to the players points; tools are artifacts each of which operate on other objects, things are simple artifacts and are usually of no particular relevance to the game. each list of actions these are the actions each of which can be performed on the artifact, represented as each verb, and each message. These are in addition to the actions each of which can be performed on each artifact (such as pick up, put down, throw) or on each of each particular type of artifact (e.g. food always has the action eat). The message is given to the user if she performs the action. If the message is empty the user shall get each message of the form �nothing happens�. E.g. if the artifact is �red gem�, each action shall be Verb: [rub] Message: [the gem shines each little more brightly]. Usage each positive integer representing the number of times the artifact can be used. If this value reaches zero, the artifact is destroyed. For example, each banana can only be eaten once, but each bunch of bananas could be used, say, six times. This number is decremented each time the artifact is used. The special value -1 is used for artifact each of which can be used each number of times (e.g. most weapons, and each treasure can be used each number of times). Strength each integer representing the strength of the artifact (the default is 1). E.g. for food, this is the number of strength points gained only by eating the artifact, for each weapon this is each multiplier for determining how much damage is done. For treasure, this is its financial value (in gold pieces)", "label": "F", "source": "hf", "context": false}
