# Session Meta
Date: 2025‑04‑18  
Participants: AO‑01, AO‑02, AO‑03  
Prototype Version: v0.7  

# Verbatim Highlights
• “It guessed ‘Catering’ instead of ‘Office Lunch’—close, but not perfect.” {highlight}  
• “Why does the OCR freak out when the receipt is wrinkled?” {pain}  
• “Great job auto-categorising Amazon receipts; that saved me so much time!” {delight}  
• “Took forever to process a blurry receipt—made me retry three times.” {pain}  
• “Confused parking fees with transport expenses—not intuitive enough.” {pain}  
• “Wish I could easily edit the category after it's processed—too many taps.” {pain}  
• “Loved the simplicity of the overview dashboard.” {highlight}  
• “It doesn’t recognize handwritten tips—annoying.” {pain}  
• “Super handy to get instant totals by category at month-end.” {highlight}  

# Observed Behaviours
1. User dragged PDF instead of JPEG (auto‑converted?)  
2. Spammed **“Re‑scan”** button 4× after mis‑tag.  
3. Couldn’t quickly locate manual edit option; visibly frustrated.  
4. AO‑02 repeatedly pressed category dropdown hoping for auto-suggestions.  
5. Skipped the onboarding tips instantly.  
6. Leave one step blank: “____ (TBD)”.  

# Quick‑Win Ideas
- AI “fuzzy‑match” to map ‘Starbucs’→‘Starbucks’.  
- Smart rules engine suggests GL code ✅/❌.  
- Allow one-tap edits directly from category results screen. [OPEN Q]  

# Next Steps
☐ Validate OCR edge cases (Owner: Dev)  
☐ Heuristic categorisation accuracy ≥ 90 % (Owner: Data)  
☐ Improve UI visibility for manual category edits (Owner: UX)  
☐ – leave one checkbox line empty
