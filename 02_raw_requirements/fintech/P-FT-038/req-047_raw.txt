**Context**  
In accordance with Article 32 of the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), we maintain a maximum allowable latency ceiling of 500 milliseconds for API response times. This benchmark is critical to ensuring the accessibility and performance standards required for secure and reliable customer service in the European Economic Area.

**Evidence**  
A 30-day extract of our operational logs confirms compliance, with the 95th percentile (P95) of API latency measured at 412 milliseconds. This value remains well within the mandated 500 ms ceiling. A snippet of the relevant data is provided below for reference:

`{ "period": "30d", "metric": "api_latency_ms", "P95": 412 }`

**Fallback**  
In the event that our primary infrastructure exceeds operational thresholds or experiences degradation, we initiate an automated failover to our EU‑West‑2 cluster within 45 seconds. Additionally, any service degradation events triggering failover will be reported to the relevant National Competent Authority (NCA) within 24 hours, as stipulated by PSD2 incident reporting guidelines.
