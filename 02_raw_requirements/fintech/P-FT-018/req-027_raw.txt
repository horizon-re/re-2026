SLIDE 4: Localization Gaps in Billing & Messaging
• Invoices require region‑specific phrasing for VAT/GST and local compliance (Owner?).
• Email templates often deviate from brand voice in non-English locales.
• Translations are outsourced, but QA is manual—leading to inconsistencies at scale.
• [RISK: Hardcoded strings from legacy invoice templates break when translated.]
• Our LLM-powered “Translation QA Bot” flags mismatched tone and jurisdiction-specific tax terminology.
• Workflow for escalation of flagged content still under definition (TBC).

SLIDE 5: Framework: AI-Assisted Template Governance
• Introduce a central hub for multi-locale email and invoice templates (Owner?).
• Leverage LLMs to suggest glossary terms and enforce tone alignment.
• [RISK: Auto-suggestions may drift from approved brand lexicon under noisy data conditions.]
• Translation QA Bot integrates with staging environments for pre-deployment review.
• Governance checkpoints include human-in-the-loop reviews and audit trails (TBC).

SLIDE 6: Roadmap & Globalization Outcomes
• Phase 1 rollout targeting LATAM markets with invoice template variants.

• [RISK: Regional linguistic nuance may affect legal enforceability of translated invoices.]
• Translation QA Bot supports rule-based checks per geography.
• Enable real-time feedback loop from customer support on template mismatches (Owner?).
• Business outcome: faster time to market with 70%+ reduction in localization escalations.
