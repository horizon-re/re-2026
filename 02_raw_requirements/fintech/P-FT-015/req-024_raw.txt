### Vision & Goals  
• Make user onboarding KYC-compliant without killing conversion  
  – 80% of users complete KYC in under 5 mins  
  – Cut manual review queue by at least 60%  
  – Regional compliance coverage in top 3 markets  

### Must‑Have Features  
• Front-camera selfie capture w/ liveness check  
• Upload gov’t-issued ID (passport, DL, etc.)  
• Name + DOB auto-extract from ID [TODO @Elena]  
• Manual override panel for compliance reviewers  
• Local language support for ID types (esp. non-Latin scripts)  
• Error-handling flow for mismatched fields [TODO @Marco]  
• Email+SMS fallback if real-time verification fails  

### AI Automation Ideas  
• “Smart‑ID Verification Bot” flags blurry image uploads + prompts user to re-capture before sending to human reviewer  
• ML-based “Risk‑Score Predictor” generates probability score (% likelihood of fraud) — Marco to tune thresholding?  
• All PII processed only in-region; redact unnecessary fields before logging to backend  

### Compliance & Regions  
• EU – GDPR-compliant storage + AML5 checklist (beneficial ownership, PEPs)  
• US – FinCEN Customer Due Diligence rule (must flag shell corps)  
• Indonesia – OJK requires…  

### Open Questions  
• How might we speed up retries without frustrating legit users?  
• Should we auto-reject expired IDs or allow grace period?  
• What’s the fallback if selfie verification fails on low-end devices?
