Executive Summary

We are pleased to submit our proposal in response to your RFP for a next-generation financial reconciliation and ledger solution. Our platform is purpose-built to deliver real-time accuracy, auditability, and operational resilience, leveraging a scalable technical foundation and an AI-driven reconciliation engine.
Our mission is to empower your organization with transparent, compliant, and automated financial operations, supporting sustainable growth and regulatory readiness. With extensive experience in financial systems, cloud-native infrastructure, and secure data management, we are confident in our ability to exceed your performance, compliance, and service expectations.

Compliance & Certifications

SOC 2 Type II Compliance

Our platform is audited annually under the American Institute of CPAs’ (AICPA) SOC 2 Type II standards, covering the Trust Services Criteria of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Our 2025 audit scope includes all production systems, client data flows, access controls, change management processes, and incident response mechanisms.

ISO 27001 Certification

We maintain full ISO 27001 certification across our infrastructure, policies, and procedures, certified by an accredited third-party auditor. Our ISO 27001 scope encompasses cloud hosting environments, physical office security, endpoint management, and data governance.

Audit Cadence

We undergo independent external audits on the following cadence:
	•	SOC 2 Type II: Annually
	•	ISO 27001 Surveillance: Annually
	•	ISO 27001 Recertification: Every three years
Internal control self-assessments are conducted quarterly, supplemented by semi-annual penetration tests performed by CREST-certified vendors.

Technical Architecture

Real-Time Ledger Design

Our ledger engine is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency transaction ingestion.
Key features include:
	•	Double-entry accounting model ensuring atomicity and immutability.
	•	Partitioned transaction journals for scalability and isolation across clients.
	•	Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to enable parallel reads and writes without locks.
Ledger data is persisted to a cloud-native relational database with strong ACID guarantees.

Failover Clusters

The system operates in an active-active cluster model across two distinct cloud availability zones per region, with automatic failover triggered within 30 seconds upon detection of node or zone failures.
Disaster Recovery (DR) readiness is ensured via:
	•	Hourly snapshots of ledger state.
	•	Warm standby region maintained at 80% capacity, located geographically distant from the primary region.

Data Retention Policies

Transaction data, audit trails, and reconciliation records are retained for a minimum of 7 years, configurable up to 10 years based on client-specific compliance requirements.
Data is encrypted at rest with AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.3. End-of-retention deletions follow GDPR and CCPA-compliant workflows, including secure erasure verification logs.

AI Reconciliation Engine

Data Model

The reconciliation engine ingests structured financial events into a normalized data schema encompassing transactional metadata, entity identifiers, reference fields, and reconciliation status.
The model supports:
	•	Multi-ledger reconciliation (e.g., payment processor vs. bank settlement ledger).
	•	Hierarchical mapping for nested transactions (e.g., payouts containing sub-transactions).
	•	Custom reconciliation rules definable per client.

Reconciliation SLA
	•	Match Rate: ≥ 99.5% within 4 hours of transaction ingestion.
	•	Discrepancy Resolution SLA: Flagging and auto-triage within 15 minutes of mismatch detection.

Anomaly Detection

The AI engine utilizes:
	•	Time-series forecasting models to predict expected volume and value trends.
	•	Unsupervised clustering to detect novel transaction patterns indicative of fraud, operational errors, or reconciliation drift.
Anomalies are scored based on confidence thresholds and escalated via automated alerts and ticket generation.
