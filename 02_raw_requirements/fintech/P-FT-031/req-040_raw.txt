Implement nightly auto-conversion of rewards point balances under 1 FX-adjusted USD to cash, applying local currency rounding rules. Credit resulting amounts to users’ wallets using a ledger entry of type='micro_cashout'. Additionally, expose a user-facing setting `autoCashout=true` in account preferences to enable or disable this feature. Ensure the process respects real-time FX rates and updates user balances accordingly while maintaining full auditability in the ledger.
