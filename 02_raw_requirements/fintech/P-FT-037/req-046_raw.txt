The system must enable merchants to supply a `brandColor` in hexadecimal format and a `logoUrl` pointing to an image asset when generating payment links, validating that the provided image is either PNG or JPG format and does not exceed 100 KB, explicitly rejecting images outside these criteria; ensure that payment link pages load branded assets within a 95th percentile latency of less than 300 milliseconds, rolled out behind the feature flag `paylink_branding_v1`, enabled by default for organizations created after 1 May 2025, and automatically triggering an SLA breach alert to the `#payments-oncall` channel in case of latency violations or validation failures.
