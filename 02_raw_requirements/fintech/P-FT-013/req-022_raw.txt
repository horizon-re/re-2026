Certainly! Here's a draft support ticket from Olivia Martins' perspective:

---

**Problem Statement:**
We currently spend valuable time every Friday exporting and emailing KPI reports manually. This process is inefficient and prone to errors.

**Desired Outcome:**
Automate the generation and delivery of weekly KPI reports without manual intervention. Ops and finance managers should receive a CSV and a branded PDF with the click of a button.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. A scheduled job runs every Friday at 17:00 local time to generate reports.
2. Reports are generated in CSV and branded PDF formats.
3. Implement retry logic and audit logging to comply with SOC 2 standards.
4. Notifications are sent to Slack's "#ops-alerts" channel for success and failure events.
5. Reports are emailed using SES or SMTP to designated recipients.
6. The solution is user-friendly with a one-click "Email KPI Pack" function.

**Constraints:**
1. Avoid disrupting existing workflows or tools like Domo or Looker.
2. Ensure the solution is robust against data inconsistencies or failures during report generation.

**Open Questions:**
1. Should the CSV and PDF be attached separately or merged into a single file?
2. What specific branding elements should be included in the PDF?
3. Are there any additional security requirements beyond SOC 2 compliance?

This should provide a clear and concise overview of Olivia's requirements and expectations for automating the KPI report generation process.
