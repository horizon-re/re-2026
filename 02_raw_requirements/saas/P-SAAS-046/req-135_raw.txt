### Encryption Overview

Our organization maintains stringent encryption protocols to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data throughout its lifecycle. Data at rest is protected using **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a 256-bit key length (AES-256)**, the industry gold standard for cryptographic security. This algorithm is applied across all storage layers including relational databases, object storage, and cached data, with encryption enforced at the disk and file levels.

For data in transit, we exclusively employ **Transport Layer Security (TLS) version 1.3**, the latest and most secure version of the TLS protocol. This ensures end-to-end encryption between clients, services, and external endpoints, eliminating support for legacy ciphers and reducing the surface area for downgrade attacks or man-in-the-middle threats.

To enhance encryption hygiene and reduce key exposure risk, we utilize a **Key Management System (KMS)** with automatic **key rotation policies**. Keys are rotated every 90 days or sooner based on compliance needs and threat intelligence. All keys are managed centrally with audit logs maintained for all access events, ensuring full traceability and compliance alignment.

### Privacy Controls

We prioritize user privacy and granular access management through robust, layered controls.

Firstly, our platform supports **role-based data masking**, ensuring that users only see data relevant to their access level. Sensitive fields such as Social Insurance Numbers (SIN), payment information, and personal identifiers are dynamically obfuscated unless explicitly permitted. This is implemented at the application level and backed by audit trails to enforce non-repudiation.

Secondly, we have implemented **field-level consent management**, allowing users to selectively grant or revoke consent for individual data fields. This provides fine-grained control over personal data processing and aligns with global data privacy regulations such as GDPR and Canada’s PIPEDA. Consent statuses are version-controlled and stored in a tamper-evident log, enabling full historical traceability for compliance audits or user inquiries.

Additionally, all internal access to user data is governed by **zero-trust principles**, requiring multi-factor authentication, purpose-specific access approvals, and session logging. These measures ensure that data privacy is not only configurable but enforceable by design.

### Scalability Architecture

To support rapid user growth and fluctuating workloads, our platform is architected for scale using modern distributed technologies. The core application stack follows a **microservices architecture**, where each service is independently deployable and loosely coupled. This enables us to scale subsystems independently and ensure continuous delivery with minimal downtime.

All services are deployed within a **Kubernetes cluster**, hosted across multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance. Each service is monitored and auto-scaled using **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** configurations, which adjust the number of running pods based on CPU utilization, memory thresholds, and custom business metrics.

Our current deployment comfortably scales to **10× our daily peak usage** within seconds, as validated by production load tests. This elasticity ensures consistent performance during high-demand events such as product launches, campaigns, or third-party integrations.

We also maintain a dedicated **observability stack** (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki) that enables real-time visibility into system health, latency metrics, and failure patterns—supporting proactive issue resolution and optimal resource allocation.

### Compliance Roadmap

We are committed to maintaining a robust compliance posture in line with industry standards and regulatory requirements.

We are currently undergoing the **SOC 2 Type II** attestation process, with controls in place and evidence collection actively underway. This certification, which covers Security, Availability, and Confidentiality principles, is being guided by a certified third-party auditor, and we anticipate finalization in **Q3 2025**.

In parallel, we have initiated preparations for an **ISO/IEC 27001** audit, the international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). We are on track for the formal audit in **Q4 2025**, supported by a dedicated compliance team, risk register, asset classification framework, and documented ISMS processes.

Our internal policies and training programs are continuously updated to reflect best practices and regulatory shifts. Employees undergo mandatory annual training on data protection, secure coding, and incident response, with refresher modules tied to observed policy breaches or changes in compliance requirements.

### Risk & Mitigation

We maintain a proactive, multi-layered strategy to identify, mitigate, and recover from risks across our infrastructure.

Our first layer of defense includes **DDoS shielding** using a combination of upstream rate-limiting, WAF rulesets, and integration with CDN providers like Cloudflare and AWS Shield Advanced. This protects the application from volumetric attacks and ensures minimal impact on end-user availability.

To harden our infrastructure against unknown unknowns, we conduct **chaos engineering tests** on staging environments. These simulations intentionally introduce failure scenarios—such as pod crashes, latency injection, or zone outages—to evaluate system resilience and uncover hidden bottlenecks. Results feed directly into architectural hardening cycles.

In addition, we perform **quarterly penetration tests** via independent third-party security firms. These tests include black-box and white-box assessments of both application and infrastructure layers. Findings are tracked in a secure vulnerability management system, prioritized by CVSS scores, and resolved through a formal remediation process.

All risk activities are logged, monitored, and reviewed by our internal security governance team to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with evolving threat landscapes.

**Conclusion**

Through rigorous encryption, privacy-centric controls, a cloud-native scalability model, a forward-looking compliance roadmap, and a proactive risk management program, we maintain enterprise-grade security and operational excellence. Our systems are engineered not only for resilience and scale, but for trust—ensuring that both our partners and users remain secure in a dynamic digital landscape.
