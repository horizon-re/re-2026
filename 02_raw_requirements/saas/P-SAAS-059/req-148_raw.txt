**Feature Request: Embed GraphQL Monaco Editor in Markdown WYSIWYG**

We need to embed a GraphQL-enabled Monaco editor within the Markdown WYSIWYG editor of the dev portal. The integration must allow developers to write and test GraphQL queries seamlessly within markdown blocks. Markdown shortcuts (e.g., `**bold**`, `# headers`) must remain fully functional outside of the GraphQL code blocks. Within these code blocks, the editor should support Ctrl + Space for GraphQL schema hints and IntelliSense.

Ensure the embedded editor adapts to dark mode and preserves styling consistency with the rest of the dev portal. Development should start Monday, with a working PoC ready for review by Friday. This feature will improve DX when documenting APIs that use GraphQL by enabling inline query testing and formatting.
