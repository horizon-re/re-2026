Title: Integrate SAML SSO with Okta and Azure AD

Description:
Business Need: Implement enterprise-grade Single Sign-On (SSO) to enhance security and streamline user access. This is crucial for attracting and onboarding enterprise clients who require robust authentication mechanisms.

Current Issue: Existing Okta integration has failures that are currently blocking the onboarding of new clients. Resolving this is a high priority.

Requirement: The solution must support integration with both Okta and Azure AD as Identity Providers (IdPs) to cater to a wider range of potential clients.

Acceptance Criteria:
* Metadata upload endpoint for Service Provider (SP) XML is implemented.
* Metadata upload endpoint for Identity Provider (IdP) XML is implemented.
* Certificate rotation is automated every 90 days.
* Automatic retry mechanism is implemented for 5xx errors with exponential backoff.
* End-user test flow for both Okta and Azure AD is documented in Confluence.
