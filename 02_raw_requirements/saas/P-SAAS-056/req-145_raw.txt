The e-sign platform must automatically detect contradictions between contract body text and margin notes, such as discrepancies like “perpetual” vs. “3 years” in term clauses. Upon identifying a conflict, the system must set the contract’s STATUS to CONTRADICTION and prevent signature until resolved. A prompt will appear in the UI for the drafter to select the binding term from a dropdown populated with both conflicting values. Once a selection is made, the system must log both the original and selected versions to a `clause_history` audit table, ensuring traceability. Additionally, a real-time Slack alert must be triggered and sent to the `#legal-ops` channel to notify the legal operations team of the flagged contradiction. This process ensures legal consistency, maintains compliance integrity, and creates a verifiable record of contract clause edits.
