**Bug Report: Notes Toast Displays Incorrect Comment Count Due to int64 Overflow**

**Summary:**  
The Notes toast currently displays an incorrect comment count of `9,223,372,036,854,775,808`, which is indicative of an int64 overflow. This creates confusion for users and may affect analytics accuracy.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  
1. Open Notes on any large-thread project.  
2. Trigger a toast notification for comment activity.  
3. Observe the displayed count.

**Expected Result:**  
The comment count should reflect the actual number or be capped appropriately.

**Actual Result:**  
An overflowed value is shown, misrepresenting the comment total.

**Proposed Fix:**  
- Switch counter data type to unsigned 128-bit integer to future-proof the system.  
- Introduce pagination for values exceeding 1 million.  
- Add a UI cap displaying “99 K+” for readability.  
- Include a Jest regression test to prevent reoccurrence.

**Severity:** High  
**Deadline:** Next sprint
