I'm using GraphQL with a custom auth middleware, but a mis-scoped query exposed sensitive fields under `__typename`, which could reveal PII (e.g., user roles or restricted types) even if field access is denied. This was discovered during a legal privacy audit, so urgent guidance is needed.

Minimal repro:
```graphql
query {
  user {
    __typename
    email  # properly secured
  }
}
```
Due to how `__typename` resolves, it leaks model-specific info that should be protected.

What are best practices to prevent this? Should I use schema directives to control `__typename` visibility, or enforce field-level auth rules that handle introspection?
