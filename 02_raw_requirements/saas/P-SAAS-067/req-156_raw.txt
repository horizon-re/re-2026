**Incident Report**

**Summary:**  
On April 22, 2025, during a routine export from the chatbot analytics system, data from multiple tenants was inadvertently combined into a single export file. The issue resulted in the exposure of chatbot interaction data involving 17 patients across different healthcare tenants. The export file was accessed via a shared link distributed to one intended recipient, but due to the mixed content, it posed a privacy risk.

**Root Cause:**  
The incident was caused by a faulty `JOIN` clause in the export cron job script, which failed to properly filter records based on the correct `tenant_id`. As a result, rows belonging to different tenants were joined and included in the same export payload.

**Immediate Mitigation:**  
Upon detection, the exported file was immediately purged from the server, and the public link was revoked to prevent further access. Access tokens associated with the chatbot export system were rotated to ensure no additional unauthorized access could occur. The recipient was promptly notified and confirmed deletion of the file on their end.

**Long-Term Fix:**  
A tenant filter has been explicitly added to the export query to ensure only data from the requesting tenant is included. Additionally, a per-row tenant ID validation policy has been enforced during the export process. To further safeguard against such occurrences, a post-export differential integrity test will be run before any file is shared, comparing expected tenant data boundaries against the actual export contents.
