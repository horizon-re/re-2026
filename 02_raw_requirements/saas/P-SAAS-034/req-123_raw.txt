Noted — this is the third merge-tag failure this month. We need to address this head-on: please implement regression tests specifically for the merge-tag parser to prevent recurrence. Also set up real-time monitoring of email render errors, with auto-alerts to #email-ops if the failure rate exceeds 0.1%. This will ensure rapid awareness and triage. Finally, the fix must be developed, tested, and deployed no later than Friday 18:00 UTC. Let’s close this loop properly — confirm ownership and ETA by EOD.
