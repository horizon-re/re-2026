The billing rollover CRON job is misconfigured with an invalid schedule: `24:60 UTC on 30 Feb`. This hotfix updates the schedule to `00:00 UTC on the last day of the month`. The PR must include a unit test validating correct trigger behavior across leap years, 30- and 31-day months. As part of the code-freeze policy, the PR is gated—**next evaluated trigger must resolve to `2025-02-28 00:00 UTC`**, with proof via test output or logs. Please coordinate with the scheduler maintainer if changes affect adjacent jobs. All reviewers should verify boundary cases before approving.
