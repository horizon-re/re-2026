It was decided that custom roles will be implemented to provide greater flexibility and granularity in access control. Furthermore, the meeting addressed and clarified the rules governing inheritance for these roles, ensuring a clear understanding of how permissions will be propagated throughout the system. Documenting decisions is a fundamental aspect of meeting minutes, providing a reference point for future actions and ensuring everyone is aligned on the agreed-upon outcomes.1Action ItemsFollowing the discussions, specific tasks were assigned to team members to drive progress on the identified areas. The following action items were agreed upon:
Define the role hierarchy within Confluence. This task is assigned to @alice, who will be responsible for outlining the structure and relationships between the different custom roles. Clearly defined action items with assigned owners are crucial for ensuring accountability and tracking progress.1

Next StepsTo further advance the work on role management and ensure its alignment with overall security policies, the following next steps were identified:
Schedule a policy review. This review will involve relevant stakeholders to ensure the implemented custom roles and inheritance rules adhere to the organization's broader security and compliance requirements. Identifying next steps in meeting minutes helps to maintain momentum and plan future activities.1
